# Make Your Own Game
Make Your Own Game is a first-person puzzle game that features a strong narrative component. You play as the Author who explores the worlds, overcomes the challenges and makes tough decisions that impact the next stages. Your goal is to make a game. The Voice will narrate the whole adventure from start to finish, but it's up to you whether you listen to it or ignore it. You would have to go from a "Goal" to a "Deadline", then find yourself in "Criticism" and eventually in "Burning out".

This project acts as a meta-commentary about making a game, why it is a long and tedious process, and where it leads.
